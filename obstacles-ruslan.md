## Ruslan's part

### Ruslan - Problem 1

// It is difficult to establish a basic template for the layout in a short time.

When preparing the design of the website we are faced with coordination problems we lack an efficient process.

We spend to much time with this part of the project.

Solution for the next project: invest more time into the wireframe defining a mature CSS solution

### Ruslan - Problem 2

We are experiencing difficulties with the management of GitHub.

One point is that we have set up Visual Studio Code in different ways.

Solution for the next project: set up Visual Studio Code in the same way for each developer.
